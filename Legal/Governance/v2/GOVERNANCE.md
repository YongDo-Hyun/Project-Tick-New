Welcome to Project Tick!

This document discusses the Project Tick ecosystem, repository management methods, and governance structure.

## Management

Project Tick's CI/CD requirements can be viewed via Github Actions, or through the Git repositories: git.projecttick.org, git.projecttick.net, or gitweb.projecttick.net. Even though Project Tick hasn't completely abandoned the Pull Request model, the contribution threshold is very low with Pull Request. To briefly explain; you create a patch and normally open a PR, right? However, we don't use the Merge, Squash, or Rebase Merge model.

### Pull Request Model

As mentioned above, you submit a PR, it's reviewed, CI/CD runs, and if your results are successful, your contributions are added to the main feed via the .patch file provided by Github with the caption "Reviewed-by: <Reviewer name> <<EMAIL>>", signed, and included. It's that simple! Isn't it?

### Maintainer model

Maintainers are responsible for maintaining a project's folder located in .github/CODEOWNERS or ci/OWNERS. If you're wondering how to become a maintainer – how to manage a project's folder according to Project Tick standards and improve it – our model is very simple. You contribute over the long term, and if deemed suitable, your name will be given to the necessary files in that folder, making you a maintainer. Dear maintainers, we expect you to treat contributors well and respectfully under the Code of Conduct. Please do your best to do so.

### Repository Model

Our repositories are continuously and actively mirrored on GitHub and GitLab. Just because you develop and create a project on GitHub doesn't mean we operate entirely through GitHub. git.projecttick.org is always open for you to clone and modify the repository, but since our internal infrastructure doesn't host Gerrit or SM GitLab, code review isn't done through those platforms and is entirely managed through GitHub.

### Decision-Making Model

The decision-making mechanism is entirely under the control of the top person, [Mehmet Samet Duman][1]. He evaluates the PULL requests approved by the maintainers and adds his own Reviewed-by tag. Mehmet Samet Duman will add the tag in the format: Reviewed-by: Mehmet Samet Duman <yongdohyun@projecttick.org>. At the same time, the Maintainer's Reviewed-by tag is added, and patches are added to the main feed as is. Then, the PR and, if applicable, the Issue are given the necessary tags, and a thank you is given before closing the Pull and any Issues. If the maintainer exercises their veto right and it doesn't pass Mehmet Samet Duman's approval, that PR will be unconditionally closed. However, if you think this is unfair, you can send a complaint to <projecttick@projecttick.org> with the [ISSUE] tag.

### Patch Acceptance Model

Your PRs are subjected to rigorous testing via CI/CD. Afterwards, the maintainer of the relevant area reviews the patch, and if it's logical and doesn't contain bad code, the maintainer uses "approve" and calls BDFL (Mehmet Samet Duman). He approves, and the patch is included in the main workflow. It's actually very simple. Maintainers can request fixes in patches, and if you approve the request and make the necessary changes, your chances of approval will increase. Conversely, if you refuse without a solid reason, the Maintainer will have veto power. As for bad code, it refers to going to great lengths to make things easier when they could be done more concisely. Don't bloat your codebases just to appear more visible or show off in Git Blame. If there are many maintainers in a region, for example, a folder and a top maintainer might be on the same project, a vote is held with +1 or -1 votes, and the one with the most votes takes effect. For example, in the MNV folder, you made a change to the tests and submitted a PR. The PR is reviewed by the maintainers, and if one requests the change and another agrees, all repository maintainers are called to the PR for a vote. However, each maintainer reserves the right not to vote. If the number of votes is equal, the final decision is made by the BDFL.

### Commit & Sign-off Model

Commits are made using the DCO standard, meaning signed-off-by. If DCO is not used, the PR bot will give an error, and if it is not corrected, the patch will be rejected. Please describe what you did in detail in your commits using Header, Body, and Footer.

### Inactive Maintainers Model

If a maintainer is unavailable, their position will be vacated. Maintainers, please let us know if you are leaving your post, are tired, or going on vacation. A maintainer can be offline for a maximum of 75 days if they don't have a valid reason or health issue. If a maintainer resigns or is dismissed, BDFL will replace the maintainer.

### Bug Control Model

Your bug reports will be retrieved via bugs.projecttick.org. If you have any questions or issues regarding development, you can contact us via lists.projecttick.net. bugs.projecttick.org is based on Bugzilla. If you find a bug or encounter a problem and want to report it, go to bugs.projecttick.org and log in with SSO. Your SSO account can be created via id.projecttick.net. Then, click the "File a bug" button and select a product. Let's take MNV as an example. After selecting MNV, choose the version from the version counter, then specify your system and operating system. Immediately after that, select the effect the bug caused. Then, detail how you can replicate it. That's it! Your bug has been recorded. Maintainer or BDFL, who are experts in their field, will review the issue and resolve the bug as soon as possible. If you know programming and are interested in these things, you can also contribute via [Github][2].

### Project Tick SSO Model

Project Tick SSO uses the Keycloak infrastructure and helps you manage all your operations on projecttick.org or projecttick.net. We have prepared 4 OAuth mechanisms; Github, Gitlab, Microsoft and Google. You can create an account with these infrastructures or via email. Our website now has an SSO infrastructure instead of its own form. This will save you from account confusion, don't worry. Go ahead and create an account [Here][3]. You can manage your account from there.

### Release & Versioning Model

In our versioning model, each project has its own version, and when a project is updated, a snapshot tag is created. Its format is vYYYYMMDDHHMM. For example, when MNV version 10.0.4 is released, a snapshot tag is created. And a components.json file is added to the asset in the Github release. This file is read by MeshMC, and if there is no change in the version, the update is not visible. If the version is updated in that snapshot, MeshMC is upgraded to that version, and in this way, a fully-fledged (rolling release in code) model is achieved. This model creates continuity by constantly updating the code without breaking it, and if you are experiencing this issue, you can try the LTS versions we will release in the future. Or if you find a bug, you can report it [here][4].

### Security Model

#### How to report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it via email:

- [`projecttick@projecttick.org`](mailto:projecttick@projecttick.org)

#### What to include

When submitting a report, please include:

- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected and actual behavior
- Affected versions
- Logs or crash reports if available

### Licensing & REUSE Compliance Model

We place great importance on SPDX. We actively define the REUSE system in both the lefthook of our Bootstrap scripts and perform full scans with CI/CD. Currently, there are no issues with the REUSE lint, but we require that any new files you create include SPDX-FileCopyrightText, SPDX-FileContributor, and SPDX-License-Identifier because, as mentioned at the beginning, SPDX is one of the most important components of the license identifier, and many distros currently prioritize the presence of SPDX headers in their source code.

### AI Usage Model

Don't worry! We're not jealous of you using AI, but we don't support it, nor are we against it. Use AI, but know its limits.

- AI should never, ever use the `Signed-off-by` tag.
- Don't send AI code without reviewing it and making necessary adjustments.
- Use the `Assisted-by` tag, though optional.
- Manage AI with contextually appropriate and well-written prompts. For example, a prompt should be at least 150 words long and contain detailed logic. Otherwise, AI, or LLMs, won't fit your context and will babble. - Use a memory bank system, but never put these memory banks in a repository. If necessary, temporarily add them to `.gitignore`, and if the Assistant gets frustrated because it can't see them, politely explain it to them.

### Source of Truth Model

The main Project Tick repository is accessible via git.projecttick.{org, net} and gitweb.projecttick.net. Remember, we are not affiliated with Github (except for CI/CD). However, if these conditions are met, full independence will be achieved, and this problem will be resolved to some extent (and will continue with your donations). If full independence is achieved, we would like to state clearly that we will switch from the Gitolite model to Gerrit. Because Gerrit makes code review easier and is easy to install and use. However, this may change in future Project Tick Governance releases. We are thinking of you and you can be sure that we will act accordingly. We returned to Github due to CI/CD restrictions and CI/CD configurations, and we decided that Gitlab was not suitable for us. Gitlab is a platform with a high contribution threshold and it's difficult for contributors to reach us, but let's give them credit. But you might ask, "Didn't the contribution surface increase even more when you actually left Gitlab and went to your own infrastructure?" Don't worry. We accept your contributions via Github, as explained in the [Pull Request Model][5] section, but our process is a little different. Don't let that scare you. We have a [Gitlab mirror][6] you can check out.

### Subproject Boundaries

Each project makes its own decisions. Because we use the SnapShot tag system in this monorepository, our projects are constantly updated. However, there are differences between folder and project maintainer. Project Maintainer:

Project Tick
├── cgit
├── cmark
├── corebinutils
├── forgewrapper
├── genqrcode
├── hooks
├── images4docker
├── json4cpp
├── libnbtplusplus
├── meshmc
├── meta
├── mnv
├── neozip
├── ofborg
├── tomlplusplus
└── website

As seen above, it generally manages one of the 16 projects. However, the Folder Maintainer is only responsible for one folder within the 16 projects. If there are interdependent projects among these 16 projects, technical decisions must be made in a way that does not disrupt other products or in agreement with other project maintainers. Nothing should be broken here. Maintainers, we hope you know your place.
