# Project Tick — Glossary

## A

### Adler-32
A checksum algorithm designed by Mark Adler, used in the zlib data format.
neozip provides SIMD-accelerated implementations of Adler-32 via architecture-
specific intrinsics (SSE4.2, AVX2, NEON, VMX).

single executable file. MeshMC distributes Linux releases as AppImages.

### Autotools
A build system suite (autoconf, automake, libtool) used by several
sub-projects including genqrcode. The `./autogen.sh` script bootstraps
the build, producing `configure` and `Makefile.in`.
